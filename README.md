# EAMB
Error-Aware Markov Blanket Learning for Causal Feature Selection

"EAMB.m" is main function.

function [MB,time] = EAMB(Data,target,alpha,k_or)
% Input :
% Data is the data matrix, and rows represent the number of samples and columns represent the number of nodes.
% target is the index of target node.
% alpha is the significance level, e.g., 0.01 or 0.05.
% k_or is recall coefficientm, and k_orâˆˆ[0, 1]. Generally, k_or is taken as [0.05, 0.25]. The higher the dimension of the dataset, the smaller the value of k_or.

% Output:
% MB is the Markov blanket of the target.
% time is the runtime of the algorithm.
